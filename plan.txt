Finalizing Stuff:
- Installation
- Some P.R.

"Some other day" Stuff:
- Fix random occurring segfault on close, that's a total bust (Probably fixed, but I'm not so sure)
- Override right-click or create suggestion box (Well I've figured out how to do it, but using these 2 additional hooks, looks really uncool
- Possibly ignore current language keywords
- Add some cache for known words probably ( Size of this cache tunable)
- Possibly check if ANSI encoding file exist then do no conversion
- Well about hunspell: Looks like some users on forum want hunspell dictionaries so I will add it as static perhaps.
