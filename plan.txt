Finalizing Stuff:
- Installation
- Some P.R.

First Priority Stuff:
- Fix random occurring segfault on close, that's a total bust (seen 1 times since then)
- Add some clever options to do not look like a fool. ( Yeah that's need some tuning):
* File types to ignore or check (maybe even regular expressions)
* Size of buffer for finding next misspelling
* Override right-click or create suggestion box (Hard stuff)
* Ignore or not words with numbers
* Ignore words starting from capital letter, all capital letters, containing any capital letters
* Size of suggestion box
* Underlining color and style
- Link to Aspell website.

"Some other day" Stuff:
- Make ability to use several dictionaries at once
- Possibly ignore current language keywords
- Add some cache for known words probably ( Size of this cache tunable)
- Possibly check if ANSI encoding file exist then do no conversion

Almost denied stuff:
- Looks like hunspell is not being encouraged to be used as shared library which is uncool for us.
